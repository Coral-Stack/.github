# Coral Stack
We are a community of developers dedicated to fighting the bloat and inefficiency that plagues modern software. Our mission is to create an ecosystem of simple, focused, and blazingly fast solutions across different programming languages and platforms.

## Why We Exist
In 1995, Niklaus Wirth observed what became known as Wirth's Law:
> "Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster."

Nearly three decades later, this observation has become more relevant than ever. Even as hardware improvements have slowed from their historic pace, software has become exponentially more resource-hungry. Modern applications consume gigabytes of RAM to perform tasks that computers from the 90s could handle with megabytes - a trend that has only accelerated despite the physical limitations we're hitting in hardware advancement.
If hardware can still get faster despite hitting physical limits, why can't we push software in the same direction?

We say: Enough is enough.

## Our Philosophy

### Simplicity Above All
We firmly believe that true genius lies in making the complex simple. Our solutions follow these principles:
- Do ONE thing and do it exceptionally well
- Keep it simple and straightforward
- No unnecessary abstractions
- If it's complex, it's probably wrong

### Performance is Not Optional
- Every piece of code must be benchmarked
- Resource usage must be justified and minimal
- Efficiency is a feature, not an afterthought
- No unnecessary allocations or computational overhead

### Quality Standards
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear, concise documentation
- Reproducible benchmarks
- Minimal dependencies, maximum scrutiny

## Our Approach
1. **Rigorous Review Process**
   - Code reviews focusing on simplicity and efficiency
   - Performance benchmarking against existing solutions
   - Documentation quality

2. **No Compromises**
   - We don't accept "good enough"
   - We don't follow trends blindly
   - We don't bloat our software
   - We don't waste resources

3. **Community-Driven**
   - Decisions based on technical merit
   - Focus on practical solutions
   - Knowledge sharing and education
   - Open discussion and collaboration

## Current Focus
While we're starting with Rust due to its performance characteristics and safety guarantees, our vision extends beyond any single language. We're building a movement, not just a library collection.

## Join Us

If you're tired of:
- Dependency hell where libraries pull in hundreds of packages for simple tasks
- Solutions that prioritize "developer experience" over actual performance
- The "just import a package" mentality instead of understanding the problem
- Garbage collection being used as an excuse for poor memory management
- Framework-first thinking instead of problem-first thinking
- The assumption that hardware will compensate for inefficient software
- Copy-paste programming culture that perpetuates poor practices
- Solutions that prioritize features over fundamental efficiency
- The normalization of second-rate performance

Then you've found your community. We're looking for developers who:
- Understanding our tools from the ground up
- Writing purpose-built solutions when appropriate
- Questioning established practices
- Value simplicity and efficiency
- Making conscious choices about every byte and cycle
- Want to make a difference in the software world
